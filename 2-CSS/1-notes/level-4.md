## Flexbox
### Flexible Box Layout
It is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns.
 
## The Flex Model
A layout model that distributes space among child elements ```flex items``` within a parent element ```flex container``` along the main axis.

- ```Flex Item```: A child element within a flex container.
- ```Flex Container```: The parent element that contains and arranges flex items.
- ```Main Axis```: The primary axis along which flex items are arranged (default: row).
- ```Cross Axis```: The axis perpendicular to the main axis

## Flexbox Direction
It sets how flex items are placed in the flex container, along which axis and direction.
- ```flex-direction : row;``` : (default)  Items are arranged horizontally, from left to right
- ```flex-direction : row-reverse;``` : Items are arranged horizontally, from right to left
- ```flex-direction : column;``` :  Items are arranged vertically, from top to bottom.
- ```flex-direction : column-reverse;``` : Items are arranged vertically, from bottom to top.

## Media Queries
Help create a responsive website

```
@media (width : 600px) {
    div {
        background-color : red;
    }
}
```
- ```@media (width : 600px) { ... }```: This media query applies the styles within the block when the width of the viewport is exactly 600 pixels.

```
@media (min-width : 600px) {
    div {
        background-color : red;
    }
}
```
- ```@media (min-width : 600px) { ... }```: This media query applies the styles within the block when the width of the viewport is greater than or equal to 600 pixels.


## Practice Set 7
### Qs: Add a media query to implement the following:
