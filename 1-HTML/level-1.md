## What is HTML5?
HTML5 is a version of HTML that is designed to be backwards compatible with older versions of HTML. It includes new features and improvements that make it easier to create and maintain web pages.

## Basic HTML Page
Let's disect the HTML page to understand it better ``` ! ```  (shortcut)
> You will learn more about ``` tags ``` in [level-2.md](https://github.com/Developer-RONNIE/html-css/blob/main/1-HTML/level-2.md)
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title> 
  </head>

  </body>
</html>
```
- ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` - tells browser you are using HTML5
- ```<html>``` - root of an html document
- ```<head>``` - container for metadata
- ```<title>My First Page</title>``` - page title
- ```</head>``` 
- ```<body>``` - contains all data rendered by the browser
- ```<p>hello world</p>``` - paragraph tag

## Comments in HTML
This is part of code that should not be parsed.
```<!-- This is an HTML Comment -->```

## HTML is NOT case sensitive
> HTML is generally case-insensitive, meaning tag and attribute names are usually interpreted regardless of their case, but lowercase is the recommended standard for better readability and maintainability.

```<html>``` = ```<HTML>```

```<head>``` = ```<HEAD>```

```<body>``` = ```<BODY>```

## Conclusion

Emmit is a must-have tool for any web developer. BUT this does not mean you have to learn every single shortcut. You can use Emmit to create HTML code faster. NO ONE remembers all the shortcuts. We use then mostly by trial and error, and learning them as we go.
